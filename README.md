In this project, we engage with a dataset detailing COVID-19 deaths in the United States to perform a comprehensive analysis of the mortality trends over time. By employing parametric models, we estimate the dynamics of the virus spread. The states are then clustered based on these parameters, which serve as features to highlight similarities and differences in virus impact and response efficacy.


Time-Series Analysis: Analyze the temporal changes in COVID-19 mortality rates across different states.
Parametric Modeling: Develop models to estimate the spread patterns of COVID-19.
K-Means Clustering: Utilize k-means clustering to categorize states into groups based on the features derived from the parametric models.
Statistical Trend Analysis: Employ statistical methods to identify and analyze trends in the data, helping to understand the progression and control measures' effectiveness.
